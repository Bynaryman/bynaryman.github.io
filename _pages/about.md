Hey there, I am Louis Ledoux (or Luis Eduardo Yves Ledoux Pardo for completeness), a PhD student at the [Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC)](https://www.bsc.es) and [Universitat Polit√®cnica de Catalunya (UPC)](https://www.upc.edu).

My academic focus is on floating-point arithmetic paradigms, spanning from high-level problems down to silicon implementation. I am familiar with systolic arrays for matrix multiplications, real numbers representation, automated pipeline on ASIC and FPGA technologies, but my interests go beyond these areas.

My academic focus is on floating-point arithmetic paradigms, spanning from high-level problems down to silicon implementation. I am familiar with systolic arrays for matrix multiplications, real number representation, and automated pipelines on ASIC and FPGA technologies. However, my interests extend far beyond these areas.

On a more daily basis, my hobbies include DJ-ing, producing music, and more generally fusing art and science. I might have been too inspired by [Ovid's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovid) saying, *"ars similis cassus."* I am also the lucky partner of the cutest cat, [Ada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace), observable in the picture.
