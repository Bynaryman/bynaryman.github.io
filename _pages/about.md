I am **Louis Ledoux** (or **Luis Eduardo Yves Ledoux Pardo** for completeness), a postdoctoral researcher within the [Emeraude team at Inria/INSA Lyon](https://team.inria.fr/emeraude/). I completed my PhD at the [Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC)](https://www.bsc.es) and [Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (UPC)](https://www.upc.edu).

My academic focus is on **floating-point arithmetic paradigms**, spanning from high-level problems down to silicon implementation. I work with tools such as **MLIR**, **FloPoCo**, and **Faust** to explore hardware generation from various problem domains, including **linear algebra, machine learning, and digital signal processing**, bringing arithmetic optimization to different levels of abstraction. I am also familiar with systolic arrays for matrix multiplications, real number representation, and automated pipelines on [ASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application-specific_integrated_circuit) and [FPGA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array) technologies. I run **chip tapeouts** using open source flows like [OpenROAD](https://theopenroadproject.org) and through open silicon programs including [Google’s Open MPW](https://developers.google.com/silicon), [Tiny Tapeout](https://tinytapeout.com/), and [Efabless chipIgnite](https://efabless.com/kb-articles/submitting-a-chipignite-project).

On a more daily basis, my hobbies include DJing, producing music, crafting synthesizers, and more generally fusing art and science. I create digital art in many forms, from “chip birth” visualizations to audiovisual work in [TouchDesigner](https://derivative.ca) and instrument building beyond synthesizers. I might have been too inspired by [Ovid's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovid) saying, *"ars similis cassus."* I also share my life with my cat, **Ada** (named after [Ada Lovelace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace)), who ensures that curiosity and playfulness remain part of my daily routine and keeps this ongoing dialogue between science and art alive.

This page is also part of **binaryman**, reflecting the duality of art and science in my work and personal projects.
